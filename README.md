### A telegram bot that sends a message to a specific telegram group.

The message contains information on current system, so if this app is executed on windows the message will be "your laptop was started on Windows".
make sure to fill the variables `Token` and `groupid` with your respective information (variables are in newBotty.py main function)
to install dependencies, simply run: `pip3 requirements.txt`.

You can setup a cron job (Linux) or a task schedule (Windows) to run this Bot on reboot, that way you get a message to your phone if someone starts you Linux / Windows machine.
